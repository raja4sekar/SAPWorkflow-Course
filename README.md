# SAP Workflow Course

SAP Workflow remains a relevant tool in the world of SAP S/4HANA. With it, we can quickly activate and customize flows to be used in apps like Fiori MyInbox. Therefore, it ends up being an almost mandatory technical knowledge for a SAP Fiori consultant.

But SAP Workflow can very well be activated/changed by a functional consultant as well. Much of what we've done in the course uses standard functionality that doesn't require ABAP knowledge.

In mid-2017, when I was teaching free courses, I created this SAP Workflow course. Students who had tried to learn before were able to understand much better and, after the course, actually started working with SAP Workflow as well. Other students, who had never had contact, also did very well in their careers after the course. Years later, it is gratifying to see this because it means that the effort to prepare the course paid off.

But the course was here, stopped, in the drawer. And given that we are going through a complicated phase, with many people being displaced, many are looking for courses to improve and develop themselves. So I decided to make the entire course available for free here.

Start reading material from the Student Materials folder. I sent this material a week before the course, for the person to prepare. Then go to the Course Materials. The course is 100% practical and you will need a SAP environment to do the exercises.

If you have questions and I can help you, send me an email. Stand firm, this will all pass.
